# Git exercises
This short exercise is meant to give a hands-on experience of usual git use
cases. You will need the following commands to complete the tasks:

    git init
    git add
    git commit
    git diff
    git log
    git checkout

1. Create a new directory and initialize a git repository.

2. Create a file with dummy content and commit it to your repository.

3. Modify the content of the file and display the changes.

4. Commit the modifications and investigate the history of your repository.

5. Modify the content of the file, again, but discard the changes.


# _Bonus:_ Branches
Branches are a powerful tool to order your commits. The basic commands to
create and interact with branches are ``branch``, ``checkout``, ``merge`` and
``rebase``. Make yourself familiar with their concept by using online source or
the git man page.

There is a nice online tool that allows you to explore branching in git:

It is possible to create dummy commits by simply executing ``git commit``. This
way you can easily create complex repositories with branches and explore their
relation.
