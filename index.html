# Why version control?

* Collaboration _I'll send you my script via mail._

--

* Storing Versions (properly) _But it worked yesterday..._ ðŸ˜­

--

* Understanding what happened _I did not change anything!!11!_ ðŸ¤¬

* Backup _I replaced the wrong my_file_2_final_final.py_ ðŸ˜±

# First steps

There are many version control systems out there (e.g. Subversion, Mercurial)

We will focus on `git` which is the **de facto standard**

## As easy as **1, 2, 3**
```bash
cd my_project/
git init .  # 1
git add .  # 2
git commit -m 'Initial commit'  # 3
```
**Init**ialize your local repository, **add** the whole directory content
and make your first **commit**.

## That's it!

# The basic workflow

* `git` offers **plenty of functionality** that is extensively "documented"
(_StackOverflow. You know it's true._)

* You will only need a **handful of commands** in your day to day work:

  ```bash
  git status  # show which files have changed
  ```

  ```bash
  git diff my_file  # show what has changed
  ```

  ```bash
  git add my_file  # stage changes
  ```

  ```bash
  git commit  # commit your changes
  ```

---

# Good habits

An **atomic commit** consists of changes related to one task, one logical unit.
* Commit **frequently**
* Commit each fix or task as a **separate** change
* Only commit **completed blocks** of work

Write **meaningful** commit messages
1. Use the **imperative mood** in the subject line (**what** is done)
1. **Limit** the subject line to 50 characters
1. Use the body to explain **what** and **why**

# __de__centralized version control

Although ``git`` is a **decentralized** version control system it might be useful
to **backup** your repository on an external server (e.g. GitHub, GitLab,
remote machine, ...):

1. Setup a **remote repository** on 
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```
or clone an existing remote repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

2. Push your work to a different server to **backup** your work
```bash
git push
```

## Remotes allow for easy **collaboration** on source code
