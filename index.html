# How to git

# Why version control?

* Collaboration _I'll send you my script via mail._

--

* Storing versions (properly) _But it worked yesterday..._ ðŸ˜­

--

* Understanding what happened _I did not change anything!!11!_ ðŸ¤¬

--

* Backup _I replaced the wrong my_file_2_final_final.py_ ðŸ˜±

---

# First steps

There are many version control systems out there (e.g. Subversion, Mercurial)

We will focus on `git` which is the **de facto standard**

--

## As easy as **1, 2, 3**
```bash
cd my_project/
git init .  # 1
git add .  # 2
git commit -m 'Initial commit'  # 3
```
**Init**ialize your local repository, **add** the whole directory content
and make your first **commit**.

--

## That's it!

# git brother is watching you!

---

# The basic workflow

`git` offers **plenty of functionality** that is extensively "documented"
(_StackOverflow... you know it's true_)

--

You will only need a **handful of commands** in your day to day work:

```bash
git status  # show which files have changed
```

```bash
git diff my_file  # show what has changed
```

```bash
git add my_file  # stage changes
```

```bash
git commit  # commit your changes
```

---

# Good habits

An **atomic commit** consists of changes related to one task, one logical unit.
* Commit **frequently**
* Commit each fix or task as a **separate** change
* Only commit **completed blocks** of work

--

Write **meaningful** commit messages
1. Use the **imperative mood** in the subject line (**what** is done)
1. **Limit** the subject line to 50 characters
1. Use the body to explain what and **why**

---

# __De__centralized version control

``git`` is a **decentralized** version control system; every repository
contains the full version history

In addition, it might be useful to **backup** your repository on an external
machine (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, ...)

1. Setup a **remote** repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
   ```
   (When you `git clone` an existing repository, the remote is already
   configured)

3. Use your normal `add`, `commit` workflow to work on your code

2. Simply **push** your changes to a different machine to **backup** your work
   ```bash
   git push
   ```
